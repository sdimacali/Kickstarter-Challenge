# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose - 
To visualized campaign outcomes for Louise’s play “Fever” based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges 
Analysis : Compared the theater outcomes versus launch and the outcome based on goals in order to visualized the success of the campaign outcome.

Challenges: Could have included the months data under the outcome based on goal in order to identify which month has the highest / lowest goal accomplished in order to better analyzed the outcome using the launch data.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Graph shows that the theater outcome launch in the month of May was the most successful one with 50% success rate compared to other months. And on the other hand, December is the lowest.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the graph , goal less than 1000 came to be more successful rather goal from 3000 to 34999 and this is also known to be the highest percentage failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Could have included the months data under the outcome based on goal in order to identify which month has the highest / lowest goal accomplished in order to better analyzed the outcome using the launch data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Graph shows that the theater outcome launch in the month of May was the most successful one with 50% success rate compared to other months. And on the other hand, December is the lowest.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the graph , goal less than 1000 came to be more successful rather goal from 3000 to 34999 and this is also known to be the highest percentage failed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Could have included the months data under the outcome based on goal in order to identify which month has the highest / lowest goal accomplished in order to better analyzed the outcome using the launch data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Combination of both data sets that represents both outcome based on goal and the launch date in order to predict the budget needed for the highest and the lowest month.
